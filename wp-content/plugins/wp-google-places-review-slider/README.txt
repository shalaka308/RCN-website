Simple and easy way display your Google business reviews in your Posts, Pages, and Widget areas! Choose 2 different methods to download reviews and even works with Service Area Businesses! 

== Description ==

A great way to boost your customer confidence and Social Proof! You work hard for your 5 star business Google reviews, now you can easily display them on your WordPress site! Put your Google reviews in a slider (or responsive grid) in your widget areas or directly on the post! Works with both physical address and service area businesses! Unlike similar plugins, you can create as many Google review slider templates as you want and use them in different locations on your site!

I built this plugin to allow you to display your Google business reviews as easily as possible. There are two different methods to download the reviews and all you need are some Google search terms or your place ID.

Here's a quick video demonstration of adding Google reviews in less than 2 minutes!
